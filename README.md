# LeagueAssistant
## What is this
Currently just a program that shows gold difference between players and teams. It doesn't use memory reading so this SHOULD work after Vanguard is required for League.

There is no gui because i don't like gui programming :) (im bad at it)

Tested on Summoners Rift (custom and draft) and Howling Abyss

## Building/Running
To build it just use
```
dotnet build 
```

For running just open the .exe or do (You need to be ingame first for now)
```
dotnet run
```
